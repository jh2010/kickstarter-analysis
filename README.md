## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the analysis, it becomes obvious that in the month of May there were most 
successful outcomes for the theater based campaign in reaching their goal.
Another interesting conclusion is that the month of December shows least successful campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Successful campaigns happen when money collected fall between less than 1000 -9 999 and 35,000 to 45,000.
Based on the analysis, most of failed campaigns happen between 25,000-35,000 and between 45,000-  50,000> 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations for this dataset includes possible missing or inaccurate information from Kickstarter.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
To enhance this analysis, we can incorporate( include) another graph showing the number of backers and the average donation amount because they can give us another insight why campaigns might have been successful or failed.
